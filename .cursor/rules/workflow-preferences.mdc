# Coding workflow preferences

- focus on the areas of code relevant to the task.
- do not touch code that is unrelated to the task.
- write thorough tests for all major functionality.
- avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed.
- always think about what other methods ard areas of code might be affected by code changes.
- prefer form-urlencoded data when handling POST requests instead of json
